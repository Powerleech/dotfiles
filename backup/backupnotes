pacman -Qqm lists foreign packages; which, for must users, means AUR
pacman -Qqe lists packages that were explicitely installed.

that said,

  pacman -Qqe | grep -v "$(pacman -Qqm)" > pacman.lst

and

  cat pacman.lst | xargs pacman -S --needed --noconfirm

are the best backup/restore lines i've seen (don't remember where i got them tho).

that will install only the packages you don't have installed already as well as pull in any needed deps.  after that, -Syu and you're good to go.
